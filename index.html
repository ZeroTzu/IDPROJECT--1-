      <p>World of Warships, released back in 2015, is a game that revolves around ships of a mostly bygone era. Its faithful recreation of the biggest and mightiest ships provides an experience like no other game.
        In this game, you are able to captain one of over 400 ships that are present in the game. Many of which are modelled 1 to1 from real life ships that have existed in the 20th century.
        Furthermore, its free to play nature means anyone is welcomed to join the game and have fun. We urge you to join the community and have fun playing the game.
