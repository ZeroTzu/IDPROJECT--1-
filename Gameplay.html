        <h2>Using Torpedoes</h2>
        <div>
          <p>When using torpedoes, don't let it go down to luck. There are ways to increase your chances of hitting that enemy.

          <p> In the video above, you see an enemy Yamato coming in your direction, slightly angled. You cannot guarantee that
            the Yamato will turn before the torpedoes reach. That is why you try to predict his actions.
            In World of Warships, it is instinctive for any player to turn in( turn directly into) or turn out(turn directly away) from a destroyer when they know
            that destroyer is nearby. This is because destoyers would likely have launched torpedoes towards them, and if they continue moving perpendicular to them, they will
            be hit by the full brunt of the torpedo volleys. Thus it would make sense to turn such that the area of your ship facing the enemy is smaller.<br>
            Insert video here?<br>
            
            You can take advantage of this as a destroyer and predict where the enemy will turn, and thus where you should launch you torpedoes. In the video you can see
            the destroyer launches his torpedoes and immediately shoots at the yamato. This is done to throw off the enemy and lead them into turning towards...your torpedoes

          <h2>Don't panic, watch your enemy</h2>
          <p>When the enemy closes in on you, make sure you are aware of the appropriate time to use your cards</p>

          <p>In the video above, you can see that  an enemy Scharnhorst B is turning out of the island and moving towards you. Keep in mind that both your ship and 
            his ship has torpedoes, and his guns are likely better than yours. Don't panic, *wait until your torpedoes have a clear shot on the enemy before launching*.
            This is important. You do not want to be lured into launching and wasting your torpedoes, after which, you can be sure the enemy will be steaming ahead to kill you
            promptly. In this case, the enemy was the one who panicked and launched his torpedoes straight into the island, now you can be sure that you will get out of
            this scott free.<br>
            Also take note that you should try to remember where the weak spots of ships generally are. For german ships like Scharnhorst B, generally, you want to make sure
            your shots land slightly behind their second turret. Don't expect a citadel however.Due to their turtleback armor, shooting them from close range likely wont result in a citadel.
